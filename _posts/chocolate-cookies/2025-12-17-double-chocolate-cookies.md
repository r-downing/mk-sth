## the recipe

### ingredients

- 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened
- 2 large eggs
- 1 tablespoon real vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup white sugar
- 1/2 cup brown sugar
- 2 cups flour
- 2/3 cups cocoa powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 12+ oz dark or regular m&ms (ideally red and green if you can find them...)

### steps

- In the first bowl, add:
  - softened butter
    - A little melted is ok but try not to liquify completely. Microwave for ~2 minutes on 30% power.
  - eggs
    - Let them come to room temperature first if you can, then beat them in a separate bowl before combining with the butter
  - vanilla, white sugar, and brown sugar
- Stir it up. the butter might be a little clumpy
- In a second bowl, combine baking soda, salt, flour, and cocoa powder
- Combine the contents of the two bowls and gently stir and knead until blended. it will be very powdery at first but keep kneading until it is a uniform consistency.
- Add the m&ms and knead them in
- Roll the dough into 1-inch balls
  - You can do this before or after chilling but it's much easier when the dough is still soft
- Cover and chill the dough in the fridge for at least 15 minutes, or up to a couple days
- Preheat to 375 F
- Space out the dough balls on an un-greased, foil-lined baking sheet
- Bake for 8 minutes
